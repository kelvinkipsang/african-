<h1>
The Wolf and the Seven Little Goats
</h1>
<h2>
Story 10
</h2>
<P>


Once upon a time there lived an old mother goat in a pretty little cottage on the edge of the forest. She had seven little billy goats, and she loved them all<br/>
 dearly. On occasion she would have to leave the cottage to get food for herself and her kids, and today was one of those occasions. She called all her <br/>
 kids together to give them a little lecture on safety. “Listen carefully, my dear children”, she began. “I need to go out to get some food, and I want<br/>
 you all to be very careful because I heard there is a wolf about. If he comes here and sees you out and about he will surely gobble you all up, all of you,<br/>
 your skin, your ears, your teeth, your guts, everything. He is a very crafty wolf, and he may well try to deceive you by disguising himself, so stay inside<br/>
 the house, and don’t open the door to anybody!”<br/>
<br/>
“Don’t worry, mother, the little goats replied, “we will be really, really, careful, and do everything you say. We won’t let anybody in, don’t you worry <br/>
about us!” And so she shooed her seven little billy goats into the cottage, and made sure they locked the front door before she went on her way, into the<br/>
 forest.<br/>
<br/>
I think that wily old wolf must have been hiding behind a tree and watching the old mother goat, because only a few minutes later there was a loud knock<br/>
 on the door. “Who’s there?” shouted the oldest of the kids. “Open the door!” wolf replied, “It is your mother and I’ve got some nice things for all of you!”<br/>
 But the little goats heard the rough voice, and knew that this was not their mother, so they said: “You’re not our mother, she has a really nice sweet voice,<br/>
 and you sound all rough and rotten. You must be the wolf, so go away, because we won’t open the door!”<br/>
<br/><br/>
Eventually the wolf did wake up. He felt rather tired and heavy, especially heavy. And thirsty, boy, was he thirsty! With great difficulty he managed to raise<br/>
 himself, and started tottering towards the brook, moaning and groaning all the while. “Oh boy, oh boy, I am so thirsty, I could drink a whole river!” <br/>
 Eventually he came to the brook, and lowered his head to take a drink. But he was so heavy, what with all these stones in his stomach, that he just slid<br/> 
 down the bank and straight into the water, where he disappeared below the surface, and drowned.<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
The old mother goat and her seven little billy goats had followed the wolf at a safe distance, and when they saw the nasty creature disappear beneath the<br/>
 waves of the rook, they all started singing and dancing: “The wolf is dead! The wolf is dead, our dear mother tricked the wolf and now he is dead!<br/>
 Hurrah, hurrah!” old mother goat called all her children together. “Now listen to me, she began, first we’ll go and clean up the house, then we’ll<br/>
 have a big party with some of the wonderful things I brought back from the forest to celebrate that we all survived this adventure!” And the seven <br/>
 little billy goats had the best ever party of their lives!<br/>
