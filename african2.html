<h2>
Story 2
</h2>
<P>
Once, many centuries ago, there was a great King of Olimpopo, whose name was Hrotyar of the House of Scyld.<br/>
 They were a Viking nation, proud warriors  who built great boats to travel the seas and conquer many<br/>
 strange lands. This King Hrotyar built a great wooden hall, which he called Heorot, or the hart, and he intended<br/>
 it to be the heart of his kingdom, where he would honour the great deeds done by his warriors, and entertain visitors<br/>
 to his Kingdom them with lavish feasts. Every night, while the King was in his Kingdom, great feasts were held here, <br/>
 always accompanied by loud carousing.<br/><br/>

In that time, many, many, years ago, monsters still dwelt on the earth. Many people believed that in  the beginning of<br/> 
time some people had incurred the wrath of the gods and been outcast from human society. As time had passed these outcasts<br/>
 had grown into horribly deformed, hateful creatures, who took every opportunity to wage war against mankind, as they were <br/>
 jealous of those who lived by the grace of the gods. In the marshes near the great hall Heorot  there secretly dwelt two such<br/>
 monstrous creatures, one  called Grendel, and his mother. Grendel was as tall as two men, and as broad as four.<br/>
 He possessed enormous strength, and his entire body was covered in hard, scaly skin.  They lived in the murky waters of a dark pond,<br/> 
 and would attack lone travellers passing through the marshes.<br/><br/><br/>
 
 The news of Grendel’s mother’s attack spread quickly, and one of teh warriors went to rouse Hrotyar. He had Beowulf sent for immediately,<br/>
 and after a short counsel, Beowulf agreed without hesitation that he would follow the monster’s tracks and find her lair and destroy her. <br/>
 Hrotyar and Beowulf, accompanied by a party of warriors, followed the bloody trail to the edge of the dark lake, where they found the abandoned<br/>
 head of one of the warriors taken by the monster. Beowulf, dressed in his ringmail, helmeted and his sword at his side, dived into the water and <br/>
 started swimming towards the bottom. He encountered many snakes and sea creatures on the way, who all tried to attack him, but he fended them all off, <br/>
 until suddenly, he found himself in the grip of a being of superhuman strength and dragged down towards the bottom. Grendel’s mother had her long arm<br/>
 around his chest and dragged him down into her lair, a subterranean hall, where she threw him onto the rocky floor. She had picked up a long bladed dagger<br/>
 and tried to stab him through the heart. But she could not penetrate the hero’s mail. Beowulf managed to extract himself from her grip and struck her with<br/>
 his mighty sword, but her skin was as strong as his mail, and his blow was rrepelled.<br/><br/><br/>

They fought and struggled and Beowulf realised that this female monster’s strength was at least the equal of her son’s, Grendel. Then Beowulf spotted a sword<br/>
 hanging on the wall, bigger and longer than any he had ever seen in all his travels. He was able to pull it off the wall, and before the monster could evade<br/>
 him, he struck a terrible blow to her head, breaking her neck and killing her.<br/><br/>

Beowulf now examined this awful abode, and noticed Grendel’s body lying on a bed nearby. Using the sword, he cut off the monster’s head, and then made his <br/>
way back to the surface, carrying Grendel’s head and the mighty sword he found as trophies. As he was making his way back to the surface, he could see the <br/>
snakes and other creatures escaping, as if a spell had been broken by the death of Grendel and his mother.<br/><br/>

Another feast followed, and Beowulf and his warriors were presented with yet more rewards and treasure. Beowulf presented Grendel’s head to King Hrotyar, <br/>
as a reminder of this terrible monster’s reign of terror, and obtained the King’s permission to take the sword he had found in the monster’s lair as a <br/>
souvenir to his uncle the King of the Geats. After feasting and resting for a few days, Beowulf and his band of warriors left the land of the Danes to <br/>
return to their own homes, leaving Hrotyar and his grateful warriors to enjoy peace once more.<br/>
