The hunter and the lion
</h1>
<h2>
Story 5
</h2>
<P>
Once upon a time there was a chief in a village near the bush. This man had many sons, and one of them was the best hunter in the whole land.<br/>
 Whenever he went out hunting, he always managed to bring back much more meat than any of the other hunters in the village. But this hunter did not<br/>
 just like to provide meat for the villagers, he enjoyed the thrill of the hunt, stalking his prey and outsmarting it, and killing animals for fun.<br/>

 

The chief often reprimanded his son, because he knew that the spirits of the forest and the ancestors did not approve of killing for fun or sport. <br/>
But all his exhortations fell on deaf ears. His son’s behaviour never changed.<br/>

As for the animals, they were both afraid of and angry with this hunter, and they called a meeting of all the bush animals to discuss if there was not<br/>
 some way to could stop this man. Some suggested setting traps to catch him, but everybody agreed that this hunter was too clever to fall into a trap, <br/>
 he would surely spot it from afar. Then the lion suggested that one of them should change into the shape of a young woman, in order to seduce the hunter.<br/> 
 Then he could be lured into the bush and killed. It was decided that the lion’s wife should be the one to do this job.<br/>

The next morning, the chief’s son was getting ready to set out for the bush, he was gathering his weapons, his spear, his bow and arrows, and a machete,<br/>
 when his father approached him. “Son”, said the chief, “Please stay home today. I had a dream last night that you went into the bush and got killed by <br/>
 a wild lion! Stay home today, please!”

But the son brushed aside his father’s concerns, “Pah! Pah! Don’t worry, old man, I can take care of myself. Any beast that tries to kill me will get <br/>
off the worst, I promise you”. And with that he set off, chuckling to himself. He had a good day in the bush, and had already killed as much meat as he <br/>
could carry, so he decided to call it a day and make his way back home. Then to his surprise he saw a beautiful young girl approach him. Beautiful young <br/>
girls do not usually come this far into the bush, so he called out to her: “Sister, what are you doing here in the bush? I can see you are not from our<br/>
 village”. She smiled at him, “I heard about you”, she said, “I heard that there is a hunter who is smarter and stronger than anyone. So I decided to look<br/>
 for you, and here you are!”<br/>

“I am just on my way home”, said the hunter, “why don’t you come with me to my village, and we will eat and drink something together”. She agreed, so h took<br/>
 her back to the village and his father’s compound. The chief thought it a bit odd that this young woman had been walking around the bush all by herself,<br/>

 but he was so happy that his son had returned home, and had not been killed by a lion as his dream predicted, that he did not question her at all. The son,<br/>
 in the meantime, was falling head over heels in love with this strange young woman, and before the night was out, he asked her to be his wife. She laughed,<br/>
 and told him that she would be very happy to be his wife, but she would have to ask her father’s permission first. So they agreed that the next morning, <br/>
 they would set off early and visit her father.<br/>

So the next morning, after eating some fruit and porridge, they were read to set off. The hunter was gathering his weapons, but the girl asked him to leave<br/>
 them behind, as she explained it would be rude to turn up at her father’s house so heavily armed. The hunter agreed to this, so they set off walking through<br/>
 the bush. When they had gone some distance from the village, the girl changed herself back into her natural lion shape, and attacked the hunter, who, having<br/>
 no weapons, was unable to defend himself. That evening, while the chief sat outside his hut waiting in vain for his son’s return, the animals celebrated.<br/>
