Little Red Cap

Story 7

<P>

<br/>
Once upon a time, in a small village in a land not that far away, there lived a very sweet little girl, with her mother and father. Her grandmother lived <br/>
about half an hour’s walk away, outside the village, in a clearing in the forest that covered the whole area. The grandmother as especially fond of the <br/>
little girl, and she had made her a cute little red hat, out of velvet. The girl loved that hat so much that she wore it all hours of the day and night,<br/>
 and so people had started calling her Little Red Cap.<br/>

The grandmother was getting very old, and she had become bedridden and infirm. One day Little Re Cap’s mother called her over, and gave her a parcel to<br/>
 take to her grandmother. There is some meat here, and a bottle of wine, which will no doubt cheer her up no end. Now be nice and polite when you get there, <br/>
 say, Good morning, Grandmother when you come in, and don’t go snooping about the place, upsetting her. Go straight there, and don’t linger on the path<br/>
 through the forest, make sure you don’t run and skip, and don’t drop the bottle. Have you got all that?” Little Red Cap assured her mother that she <br/>
 understood perfectly, and would do everything just as mother told her to.<br/>

 

So off she went, down the village lane, toward the track through the wood leading to her grandmother’s house. After she had gone some distance, she heard <br/>
a rustling in the undergrowth and there appeared before her the wolf. Now this wolf was not a very nice creature, but Little Red Cap, being young and naïve,<br/>
 always assumed everybody she met was just as nice, sweet and honest as she was, so she stopped and greeted the wolf in her usual friendly way.<br/>
She heard some grumbling coming from the bedroom, so she walked inside there. It was quite dark in the room, as the curtains were still drawn, so she walked<br/>
 across, and opened the curtains and a window, to let in some fresh air. Then she turned toward the bed, where she saw what she thought was her grandmother<br/>
 lying down, her covers almost covering her whole face. She could see her ears and her eyes, both looked much larger than she remembered.<br/>

“Oh grandmother, said Little Red Cap, what great ears you have!”<br/>

That’s so I can hear you better, answered wolf.<br/>

“And what great eyes you have, grannie!”<br/>

“That’s so I can see you properly!” answered wolf, keeping his mouth covered.<br/>

“And what great hands you have, grannie!” exclaimed Little Red Cap.<br/>

“That’s so I can lift you up!” said wolf.<br/>

“But grannie, what great teeth you have!”<br/>

“That’s the better to eat you with”, shouted wolf, and he immediately threw aside the bed covers, and jumped out of bed to gobble up poor Little Red Cap.<br/>

Having now feasted on both the grannie and her little gran daughter, wolf felt particularly satisfied, and he decided he might as well enjoy the home<br/>
 comforts of grannie’s cottage a little longer, and spread himself on the bed. Before long he was fast asleep, emitting very loud snoring noises.<br/>
 Just then, a huntsman passed by the cottage, and he heard the strange noise coming from the bedroom window. His curiosity awakened, he decided to <br/>
 check out the source of this noise, and looked into the window. He immediately recognised the wolf he’d been hunting now for a number of weeks, and <br/>
 cocking his rifle, he stepped into the cottage and made his way to the bedroom. Taking careful aim, he shot the wolf dead.<br/>
