Old Mother Frost
</h1>
<h2>
Story 8
</h2>
<P>


There once lived an old widow, who had a daughter and a step daughter. Her step daughter was beautiful and hardworking, ever willing to do whatever was asked<br/>
 of her, little and large tasks, and she was always kind to everybody, including her mother and step sister. The step sister now, was rather plain looking,<br/>
 she was lazy and deceitful, and was always complaining to her mother about how her steps sister did not work hard enough, burned her toast and did not wash<br/>
 her dresses properly. The step daughter was made to sleep on a rough bed in the washing room, and for food she was only given left overs and dry bread crusts.<br/>

The poor step daughter was made to work on a spinning wheel put outside, next to a well. She worked so her, and spun so fast, that her fingers started to<br/>
 bleed. The spindle on the wheel became covered in blood, and the girl bent over the well to wash it off, otherwise she was afraid the blood might discolour<br/>
 the yarn she was spinning. But she dropped the spindle and it fell into the water. She did not want to be scolded for losing the spindle, so without thinking<br/>
 about the consequences, she hitched her skirt, and jumped into the water in order to retrieve it. But she could not feel the ground at the bottom, she kept<br/>
 sinking deeper and deeper, until eventually she lost consciousness. When she woke, she found herself in a charming meadow, covered I the greenest grass and <br/>
 a multitude of colourful flowers, all under a friendly sun spreading its warmth.

Before long she came across an apple tree, whose branches were almost touching the ground, so heavily laden were they with fruit. <br/>The apples cried out: 
”Shake the tree, shake the tree! We are all ripe, and we need to come off our tree, otherwise we will all rot away. Shake the tree!” <br/>But the lazy daughter
 just shook her head. “I’m not going to exhaust myself for a bunch of sour apples, she said, Shake yourself down if you’re so clever!”<br/>

On she went on her walk.<br/>

Before long she came to a clearing where there stood a small cottage, and in front of the cottage stood an old woman. As her step sister had explained,<br/>
 the old woman was frankly quite a sight, she was as ugly as any creature from the land of ghouls, her teeth were too long, and grew over her <br/>lips, 
 her nose was covered in grey hairs, and her bosoms hung down like flour sacks. But the lazy daughter was not afraid, having been warned.<br/>
 “So you must be Old Mother Frost” she said. Old Mother Frost confirmed that she was indeed her, and asked this new girl why she had come <br/>
 this way and where she was going. “I’ve come to give you a hand with some of your work”, the lazy daughter told her. “That’s very good, <br/>
 
 Mother Frost. Well, she worked quite well on the first day, but by evening she was so tired, she had hardly enough energy left to eat the <br/>
 wonderful food that had been prepare. So the next day she slowed down a bit, and only shook the bed in a perfunctory manner, so that only <br/>
 a few of the feathers flew out. Not much snow fell on the earth that day.

The next day she did even less, but Old Mother Frost did not complain. But the next day, the lazy daughter stayed in her bed until midday, and when she got<br/>
 up complained that there was no breakfast waiting for her. That was it for Old Mother Frost. “I’ve had enough of you, she said. I’m giving you the sack! <br/>
 You’ll have to go back to where you came from!”<br/>

The lazy daughter was of course very happy to hear these words, because she thought she would now get her sack full of gold! Old Mother Frost took her by <br/>
the arm, and led her to the great wooden gate, which she duly unlocked. Just step through here, she said, and you will return to your mother’s village. <br/>
Just as the lazy daughter, stepping through the gate, thought she was going to be handed her gold, Old Mother Frost picked up a bucket standing by the<br/>
 side of the gate, and poured the content all over the wretched girl. It was pitch black tar, which covered her all over. When the lazy daughter got home,<br/>
 however much she and her mother tried to wash it off, they could not remove it and the tar stuck to her for the rest of her life.<br/>
