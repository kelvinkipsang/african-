Story 9

<P>


Once upon a time in a faraway land there lived a cobbler and his wife. They desperately wanted to have children, but however they tried, <br/>
it was all in vain. These people lived in a little house next to a mansion, and one of their bedroom windows looked out over the wall of the<br/>
 adjoining property, into an enormous garden, where flowers and vegetables grew side by side in abundance. But nobody ever visited the garden,<br/>
 it was rumoured that the owner of the house, an old woman, was in fact a terrible witch, who possessed terrible dark powers, and as a consequence<br/>
 everybody in the little town avoided contact with her.
<br/>
But one fine morning, the cobbler’s wife was sitting at her window looking out over the garden, when she spotted a little bed full of wonderful <br/>
radishes. The sight of these radishes filled her with a great desire to have some, and however much she tried during the course of the day to<br/>
 forget about it, the desire to eat these radishes would not go away. Days and days passed, and her inability to satisfy her desire made her quite <br/>
 ill, she could hardly eat anything if she could not have the radishes. One evening her husband remarked that she looked quite unwell, and wanted<br/>
 to know what it was that was ailing her. “Oh, it’s nothing, she said, I’m just feeling a little faint. It will pass,”<br/>

More days passed, and the cobbler watched his wife getting more and more ill. So he asked her again: “My dear wife, you must be honest with me,<br/>
 tell me what the matter is.”

The witch flew back to the tower, because she knew that the knight would turn up before long. And indeed, she had only just returned, when she<br/>
 heard his voice calling from below the window: “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let down your hair!” The witch pulled out Rapunzel’s hair from under her skirt, <br/>
 and tied one end to the window, then threw it out towards the ground. After a few seconds she could hear the knight’s huffing and puffing as he <br/>
 negotiated the wall, and then he appeared in the window. She was hiding in a dark corner, and it took a few moments for the knight’s eyes to find<br/>
 her in the shadows. ”Rapunzel, he called out, it is I, why are you hiding in the corner?”. Then the witch approached him, screeching and swearing<br/>
 at him: “You rascal! You would take advantage of a poor little creature and carry her away from me. But she has flown! A cat came and took her away, <br/>
 and now this cat is so wild and angry that she is going to scratch out your eyes!” With these words, the mad witch attacked the knight, scratching at<br/>
 his face with her long sharp nails. He bent away and swayed, and managed to parry some of her blows, but he knew he would have to get away, so he took<br/>
 his chance, and jumped out of the window. But the poor guy landed on the thorn bushes, and the thorns penetrated his hands, his face, and his eyes, and<br/>
 when he got up and scrambled away from the tower, he realised he could not see anything.<br/>

The blind knight was left wandering around the forest aimlessly, feeding himself on whatever he could find, fruits and berries he found on bushes, and <br/>
roots that he managed to dig up. Forever he lamented the loss of his wife, and only the desperate hope that he might one day meet up with her again kept <br/>
him going. He roamed and roamed, and year went by, until one day he came upon a little fence, with a gate in it. He heard some voices, and his heart jumped,<br/>
 because he was sure he recognised that wonderful melodious voice! He walked in the direction of the voice, calling out: “Rapunzel, Rapunzel”.<br/>
 And it was indeed Rapunzel who dwelt in that little cottage, with her twins, who had been born shortly after the witch had left her for dead in <br/>
 the wilderness. She looked at the figure approaching her on the path, and although his hair was unkempt and long, and his beard had grown long and <br/>
 scraggy, she recognised him immediately and rushed into his arms. She cried and cried with joy, and her tears fell on his eyes, which miraculously cured<br/> 
 them, and he was able to see again! They spent the rest of their lives together, and never again allowed anything to separate them. I have tried to find<br/>
 out what became of the witch, but nobody ever saw or heard of her again.
